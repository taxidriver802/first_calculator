This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started this project to practice the necessary skills and further develop my abilities.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear button to reset the display.
- Input validation to ensure only valid characters are entered.
- History feature to store and display the last five results.

## Usage

1. Open the deployed link in your web browser.
2. Use the buttons on the calculator to perform arithmetic operations.
3. Click the "C" button to clear the display.
4. Click the "=" button to calculate the result.
5. Click the "Show History" button to view the last five results.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the calculator.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the calculator.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the calculator.

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
- Improve the user interface with better styling and animations.
- Implement a more sophisticated history feature with timestamps and the ability to clear history.
